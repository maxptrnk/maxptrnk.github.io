<p>I’m a Belgian with a Ukrainian heart. I’m 23. I've moved to Canada to study Artificial Intelligence in one of the best cities for that. Montreal. 

My curiosity has no limits. I want to find all the secrets of this world. The challenge of trying to understand intelligence, not only the human one but in general, seduced me. I’m currently a master’s student, and I’m only at the beginning of my big journey.

I'm looking for the best ways AI can have a positive impact on the world to safeguard the future for generations to come. I believe AI will change the world as much as the internet, if not more. It's the opportunity of the century.

I’m currently learning and working on my skills. At the moment, I'm particularly interested to learn about Foundation Models, Multi-Modal Models, LLMs, Game theory, Graph Theory, AI Safety.</p>
