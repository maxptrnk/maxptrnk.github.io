<p>I’m a Belgian with a Ukrainian heart.I've moved to Montreal to study Artificial Intelligence. I'm looking for the best ways AI can have a positive impact on the world to safeguard the future for generations to come. At the moment, I'm particularly interested to learn about Foundation Models, Multi-Modal Models, LLMs, Game theory, Graph Theory, AI Safety.</p>
